# COVID-19 Analysis (Python)

The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, you are required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.

The dataset we are using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about:
- The country code
- Name of all the countries
- Date of the record
- Human development index of all the countries
- Daily covid-19 cases
- Daily deaths due to covid-19
- Stringency index of the countries
- The population of the countries
- GDP per capita of the countries
